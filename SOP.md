**1−1−12. SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**
**(SMS)**

Every employee is responsible to ensure the safety of
equipment and procedures used in the provision of
services within the National Airspace System (NAS).


Risk assessment techniques and mitigations, as
appropriate, are intended for implementation of any
planned safety significant changes within the NAS, as
directed by FAA Order 1100.161, Air Traffic Safety
Oversight. Direction regarding the SMS and its
application can be found in the FAA Safety
Management System Manual and FAA
Order 1100.161. The SMS will be implemented
through a period of transitional activities. (Additional
information pertaining to these requirements and
processes can be obtained by contacting the service
area offices.)

**1−1−13. REFERENCES TO FAA NON−AIR**

**TRAFFIC ORGANIZATIONS**

When references are made to regional office
organizations that are not part of the Air Traffic
Organization (i.e., Communications Center, Flight
Standards, Airport offices, etc.), the facility should
contact the FAA region where the facility is
physically located − not the region where the
facility’s service area office is located.

**1−1−14. DISTRIBUTION**

This order is distributed to selected offices in
Washington headquarters, regional offices, service
area offices, the William J. Hughes Technical Center,
and the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center. Also,

# Chapter 2. General Control

## Section 1. General


**2−1−1. ATC SERVICE**

The primary purpose of the ATC system is to prevent
a collision between aircraft operating in the system
and to provide a safe, orderly and expeditious flow of
traffic, and to provide support for National Security
and Homeland Defense. In addition to its primary
function, the ATC system has the capability to
provide, with certain limitations, additional services.
The ability to provide additional services is limited by
many factors, such as the volume of traffic, frequency
congestion, quality of radar, controller workload,
higher priority duties, and the pure physical inability
to scan and detect those situations that fall in this
category. It is recognized that these services cannot be
provided in cases in which the provision of services
is precluded by the above factors. Consistent with the
aforementioned conditions, controllers must provide
additional service procedures to the extent permitted
by higher priority duties and other circumstances.
The provision of additional services is not optional on
the part of the controller, but rather is required when
the work situation permits. Provide air traffic control
service in accordance with the procedures and
minima in this order except when:

**a. A deviation is necessary to conform with ICAO**
Documents, National Rules of the Air, or special
agreements where the U.S. provides air traffic control
service in airspace outside the U.S. and its
possessions or:

**_NOTE−_**
_Pilots are required to abide by CFRs or other applicable_
_regulations regardless of the application of any procedure_
_or minima in this order._

**b. Other procedures/minima are prescribed in a**
letter of agreement, FAA directive, or a military
document, or:

**_NOTE−_**
_These procedures may include altitude reservations,_
_air refueling, fighter interceptor operations, law enforce-_

_ment, etc._

**_REFERENCE−_**
_FAAO JO 7110.65, Para 1−1−9 Procedural Letters of Agreement._


**c. A deviation is necessary to assist an aircraft**
when an emergency has been declared.

**_REFERENCE−_**
_FAAO JO 7110.65, Para 2−1−6 Safety Alert._
_FAAO JO 7110.65, Chapter 10 Emergencies._
_FAAO JO 7110.65, Para 5−1−8 Merging Target Procedures._

**2−1−2. DUTY PRIORITY**

**a. Give first priority to separating aircraft and**
issuing safety alerts as required in this order. Good
judgment must be used in prioritizing all other
provisions of this order based on the requirements of
the situation at hand.

**_REFERENCE−_**
_FAAO JO 7110.65, Para 2−1−6 Safety Alert._

**_NOTE−_**
_Because there are many variables involved, it is virtually_
_impossible to develop a standard list of duty priorities that_
_would apply uniformly to every conceivable situation._
_Each set of circumstances must be evaluated on its own_
_merit, and when more than one action is required,_
_controllers must exercise their best judgment based on the_
_facts and circumstances known to them. That action which_
_is most critical from a safety standpoint is performed first._

**b. Provide support to national security and**
homeland defense activities to include, but not be
limited to, reporting of suspicious and/or unusual
aircraft/pilot activities.

**_REFERENCE−_**
_FAAO JO 7610.4 Special Operations._

**c. Provide additional services to the extent**
possible, contingent only upon higher priority duties
and other factors including limitations of radar,
volume of traffic, frequency congestion, and
workload.

**2−1−3. PROCEDURAL PREFERENCE**

**a. Use automation procedures in preference to**
nonautomation procedures when workload, communications, and equipment capabilities permit.

**b. Use radar separation in preference to nonradar**
separation when it will be to an operational advantage
and workload, communications, and equipment
permit.


General 2−1−1


-----

JO 7110.65W 12/10/15


**c. Use nonradar separation in preference to radar**
separation when the situation dictates that an
operational advantage will be gained.

**_NOTE−_**
_One situation may be where vertical separation would_
_preclude excessive vectoring._

**2−1−4. OPERATIONAL PRIORITY**

Provide air traffic control service to aircraft on a “first
come, first served” basis as circumstances permit,
except the following:

**_NOTE−_**
_It is solely the pilot’s prerogative to cancel an IFR flight_
_plan. However, a pilot’s retention of an IFR flight plan does_
_not afford priority over VFR aircraft. For example, this_
_does not preclude the requirement for the pilot of an_
_arriving IFR aircraft to adjust his/her flight path, as_
_necessary, to enter a traffic pattern in sequence with_
_arriving VFR aircraft._

**a. An aircraft in distress has the right of way over**
all other air traffic.

**_REFERENCE−_**
_14 CFR Section 91.113(c)._

**b. Provide priority to civilian air ambulance**
flights (call sign “MEDEVAC”). Use of the
MEDEVAC call sign indicates that operational
priority is requested. When verbally requested,
provide priority to AIR EVAC, HOSP, and scheduled
air carrier/air taxi flights. Assist the pilots of
MEDEVAC, AIR EVAC, and HOSP aircraft to avoid
areas of significant weather and turbulent conditions.
When requested by a pilot, provide notifications to
expedite ground handling of patients, vital organs, or
urgently needed medical materials.

**_NOTE−_**
_It is recognized that heavy traffic flow may affect the_
_controller’s ability to provide priority handling. However,_
_without compromising safety, good judgment must be used_
_in each situation to facilitate the most expeditious_
_movement of a MEDEVAC aircraft._

**c. Provide maximum assistance to SAR aircraft**
performing a SAR mission.

**_REFERENCE−_**
_FAAO JO 7110.65, Para 10−1−3, Providing Assistance._

**d. Expedite the movement of presidential aircraft**
and entourage and any rescue support aircraft as well
as related control messages when traffic conditions
and communications facilities permit.


**_NOTE−_**
_As used herein the terms presidential aircraft and_
_entourage include aircraft and entourage of the President,_
_Vice President, or other public figures when designated by_
_the White House._

**_REFERENCE−_**

_FAAO JO 7110.65, Para 4−3−2 Departure Clearances._
_FAAO JO 7210.3, Para 5−1−1 Advance Coordination._

**e. Provide special handling, as required to**
expedite Flight Check aircraft.

**_NOTE−_**
_It is recognized that unexpected wind conditions, weather,_
_or heavy traffic flows may affect controller’s ability to_
_provide priority or special handling at the specific time_
_requested._

**_REFERENCE−_**
_FAAO JO 7110.65, Para 9−1−3, Flight Check Aircraft._

**f. Expedite movement of NIGHT WATCH aircraft**
when NAOC (pronounced NA−YOCK) is indicated
in the remarks section of the flight plan or in
air/ground communications.

**_NOTE−_**
_The term “NAOC” will not be a part of the call sign but may_
_be used when the aircraft is airborne to indicate a request_
_for special handling._

**_REFERENCE−_**
_FAAO JO 7610.4, Para 12−1−1 Applications._

**g. Provide expeditious handling for any civil or**
military aircraft using the code name “FLYNET.”

**h. Provide expeditious handling of aircraft using**
the code name “Garden Plot” only when CARF
notifies you that such priority is authorized. Refer any
questions regarding flight procedures to CARF for
resolution.

**_NOTE−_**
_Garden Plot flights require priority movement and are_
_coordinated by the military with CARF. State authority will_
_contact the Regional Administrator to arrange for priority_
_of National Guard troop movements within a particular_

_state._

**i. Provide special handling for USAF aircraft**
engaged in aerial sampling missions using the code
name “SAMP.”

**j. Provide maximum assistance to expedite the**
movement of interceptor aircraft on active air defense
missions until the unknown aircraft is identified.

**k. Expedite movement of Special Air Mission**
aircraft when SCOOT is indicated in the remarks
section of the flight plan or in air/ground
communications.

**_NOTE−_**
_The term “SCOOT” will not be part of the call sign but may_
_be used when the aircraft is airborne to indicate a request_
_for special handling._

**_REFERENCE−_**
_FAAO JO 7610.4, Para 12−7−1, Applications._

**l. When requested, provide priority handling to**
TEAL and NOAA mission aircraft.

**_NOTE−_**
_Priority handling may be requested by the pilot, or via_
_telephone from CARCAH or the 53rd Weather Reconnais-_
_sance Squadron (53WRS) operations center personnel, or_
_in the remarks section of the flight plan._

**m. IFR aircraft must have priority over SVFR**
aircraft.

**_REFERENCE−_**
_FAAO JO 7110.65, Chapter 7, Section 5, Special VFR (SVFR)._

**n. Providing priority and special handling to**
expedite the movement of OPEN SKIES Treaty
observation and demonstration (F and D) flights.

**_NOTE−_**
_An OPEN SKIES Treaty (F and D) aircraft has priority_
_over all “regular” air traffic. “Regular” is defined as all_
_aircraft traffic other than:_
**_1. Emergencies._**
**_2. Aircraft directly involved in presidential movement._**
**_3. Forces or activities in actual combat._**

**_4. MEDEVAC, and active SAR missions._**
_5. AIR EVAC and HOSP aircraft that have requested_
_priority handling._

**p. If able, provide priority handling to diverted**
flights. Priority handling may be requested via use of
“DVRSN” in the remarks section of the flight plan or
by the flight being placed on the Diversion Recovery
Tool (DRT).

**_REFERENCE−_**

_FAAO JO 7210.3, Para 17−4−5, Diversion Recovery._

**2−1−5. EXPEDITIOUS COMPLIANCE**

**a. Use the word “immediately” only when**
expeditious compliance is required to avoid an
imminent situation.

**b. Use the word “expedite” only when prompt**
compliance is required to avoid the development of
an imminent situation. If an “expedite” climb or
descent clearance is issued by ATC, and subsequently
the altitude to maintain is changed or restated without
an expedite instruction, the expedite instruction is
canceled.

**c. In either case, if time permits, include the reason**
for this action.

**2−1−6. SAFETY ALERT**

Issue a safety alert to an aircraft if you are aware the
aircraft is in a position/altitude that, in your judgment,
places it in unsafe proximity to terrain, obstructions,
or other aircraft. Once the pilot informs you action is
being taken to resolve the situation, you may
discontinue the issuance of further alerts. Do not
assume that because someone else has responsibility
for the aircraft that the unsafe situation has been
observed and the safety alert issued; inform the
appropriate controller.

**_NOTE−_**
**1. The issuance of a safety alert is a first priority (see**
_para 2−1−2, Duty Priority) once the controller observes_
_and recognizes a situation of unsafe aircraft proximity to_
_terrain, obstacles, or other aircraft. Conditions, such as_
_workload, traffic volume, the quality/limitations of the_
_radar system, and the available lead time to react are_
_factors in determining whether it is reasonable for the_
_controller to observe and recognize such situations. While_
_a controller cannot see immediately the development of_
_every situation where a safety alert must be issued, the_


General 2−1−3


-----

JO 7110.65W 12/10/15


_controller must remain vigilant for such situations and_
_issue a safety alert when the situation is recognized._

**2. Recognition of situations of unsafe proximity may result**
_from MSAW/E−MSAW, automatic altitude readouts,_
_Conflict/Mode C Intruder Alert, observations on a PAR_
_scope, or pilot reports._

**3. Once the alert is issued, it is solely the pilot’s**
_prerogative to determine what course of action, if any, will_
_be taken._

**a. Terrain/Obstruction Alert. Immediately issue/**
initiate an alert to an aircraft if you are aware the
aircraft is at an altitude that, in your judgment, places
it in unsafe proximity to terrain and/or obstructions.
Issue the alert as follows:

**_PHRASEOLOGY−_**
_LOW ALTITUDE ALERT (call sign),_

_CHECK YOUR ALTITUDE IMMEDIATELY._

_and, if the aircraft is not yet on final approach,_

_THE (as appropriate) MEA/MVA/MOCA/MIA IN YOUR_
_AREA IS (altitude),_

**_REFERENCE−_**
_P/CG Term − Final Approach − IFR_

**b. Aircraft Conflict/Mode C Intruder Alert.**
Immediately issue/initiate an alert to an aircraft if you
are aware of another aircraft at an altitude that you
believe places them in unsafe proximity. If feasible,
offer the pilot an alternate course of action. When an
alternate course of action is given, end the
transmission with the word “immediately.”

**_PHRASEOLOGY−_**
_TRAFFIC ALERT (call sign) (position of aircraft)_ _ADVISE_
_YOU TURN LEFT/RIGHT (heading),_

_and/or_

_CLIMB/DESCEND (specific altitude if appropriate)_
_IMMEDIATELY._

**_EXAMPLE−_**
_“Traffic Alert, Cessna Three Four Juliet, 12’o clock, 1 mile_
_advise you turn left immediately.”_

_or_
_“Traffic Alert, Cessna Three-Four Juliet, 12’o clock, 1_
_mile advise you turn left and climb immediately.”_


**_REFERENCE−_**

_FAAO JO 7110.65, Para 5−2−23, Altitude Filters._
_FAAO JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-21, Traffic Advisories_

**2−1−7. INFLIGHT EQUIPMENT**
**MALFUNCTIONS**

**a. When a pilot reports an inflight equipment**
malfunction, determine the nature and extent of any
special handling desired.

**_NOTE−_**
_Inflight equipment malfunctions include partial or_
_complete failure of equipment, which may affect either_
_safety, separation standards, and/or the ability of the flight_
_to proceed under IFR, or in Reduced Vertical Separation_
_Minimum (RVSM) airspace, in the ATC system. Control-_
_lers may expect reports from pilots regarding VOR,_
_TACAN, ADF, GPS, RVSM capability, or low frequency_
_navigation receivers, impairment of air−ground commu-_
_nications capability, or other equipment deemed_
_appropriate by the pilot (e.g., airborne weather radar)._
_Pilots should communicate the nature and extent of any_
_assistance desired from ATC._

**b. Provide the maximum assistance possible**
consistent with equipment, workload, and any special
handling requested.

**c. Relay to other controllers or facilities who will**
subsequently handle the aircraft, all pertinent details
concerning the aircraft and any special handling
required or being provided.

**2−1−8. MINIMUM FUEL**

If an aircraft declares a state of “minimum fuel,”
inform any facility to whom control jurisdiction is
transferred of the minimum fuel problem and be alert
for any occurrence which might delay the aircraft

en route.

**_NOTE−_**
_Use of the term “minimum fuel” indicates recognition by_
_a pilot that his/her fuel supply has reached a state where,_
_upon reaching destination, he/she cannot accept any undue_
_delay. This is not an emergency situation but merely an_
_advisory that indicates an emergency situation is possible_
_should any undue delay occur. A minimum fuel advisory_
_does not imply a need for traffic priority. Common sense_
_and good judgment will determine the extent of assistance_
_to be given in minimum fuel situations. If, at any time, the_


2−1−4 General


-----

12/10/15 JO 7110.65W


_remaining usable fuel supply suggests the need for traffic_
_priority to ensure a safe landing, the pilot should declare_
_an emergency and report fuel remaining in minutes._

**2−1−9. REPORTING ESSENTIAL FLIGHT**

**INFORMATION**

Report as soon as possible to the appropriate FSS,
airport manager’s office, ARTCC, approach control
facility, operations office, or military operations
office any information concerning components of the
NAS or any flight conditions which may have an
adverse effect on air safety.

**_NOTE−_**
_FSSs are responsible for classifying and disseminating_
_Notices to Airmen._

**_REFERENCE−_**

_FAAO JO 7110.65, Para 5−1−6, Service Limitations._
_FAAO JO 7210.3, Para 3−1−2, Periodic Maintenance._
_USN, See OPNAVINST 3721.30._

**2−1−10. NAVAID MALFUNCTIONS**

**a. When an aircraft reports a ground−based**
NAVAID malfunction, take the following actions:

**1. Request a report from a second aircraft.**

**2. If the second aircraft reports normal**
operations, continue use and inform the first aircraft.
Record the incident on FAA Form 7230−4 or
appropriate military form.

**3. If the second aircraft confirms the malfunc-**
tion or in the absence of a second aircraft report,
activate the standby equipment or request the monitor
facility to activate.

**4. If normal operation is reported after the**
standby equipment is activated, continue use, record
the incident on FAA Form 7230−4 or appropriate
military form, and notify technical operations
personnel (the Systems Engineer of the ARTCC
when an en route aid is involved).

**5. If continued malfunction is reported after the**
standby equipment is activated or the standby
equipment cannot be activated, inform technical
operations personnel and request advice on whether
or not the aid should be shut down. In the absence of
a second aircraft report, advise the technical
operations personnel of the time of the initial aircraft
report and the estimated time a second aircraft report
could be obtained.


**b. When an aircraft reports a GPS or WAAS**
anomaly, request the following information and/or
take the following actions:

**1. Record the following minimum information:**

**(a) Aircraft make, model, and call sign.**

**(b) Location** or position, and altitude at the
time where GPS or WAAS anomaly was observed.

**(c) Date/time of occurrence.**

**2. Request a report from a second aircraft.**

**3. Record the incident on FAA Form 7230−4 or**
appropriate military form.

**4. Inform other aircraft of the anomaly as**
specified in paragraph 4-8-1j or k, as applicable.

**_PHRASEOLOGY−_**

_ATTENTION ALL AIRCRAFT, GPS REPORTED_
_UNRELIABLE (OR WAAS UNAVAILABLE) IN_
_VICINITY/AREA (position)._

**_EXAMPLE−_**
_“Attention all aircraft, GPS reported unreliable (or WAAS_
_unavailable) in the area 30 miles south of Waco VOR.”_

**c. When a pilot reports a WAAS anomaly,**
determine from the pilot what indications he or she
observes and record the information in accordance
with sub-paragraph b above.

**2−1−11. USE OF MARSA**

**a. MARSA may only be applied to military**
operations specified in a letter of agreement or other
appropriate FAA or military document.

**_NOTE−_**
_Application of MARSA is a military command prerogative._
_It will not be invoked indiscriminately by individual units_
_or pilots. It will be used only for IFR operations requiring_
_its use. Commands authorizing MARSA will ensure that its_
_implementation and terms of use are documented and_
_coordinated with the control agency having jurisdiction_
_over the area in which the operations are conducted. Terms_
_of use will assign responsibility and provide for separation_
_among participating aircraft._

**b. ATC facilities do not invoke or deny MARSA.**
Their sole responsibility concerning the use of
MARSA is to provide separation between military
aircraft engaged in MARSA operations and other
nonparticipating IFR aircraft.

**c. DOD must ensure that military pilots requesting**
special-use airspace/ATCAAs have coordinated with
the scheduling agency, have obtained approval for

entry, and are familiar with the appropriate MARSA
procedures. ATC is not responsible for determining
which military aircraft are authorized to enter
special-use airspace/ATCAAs.

**_REFERENCE−_**
_FAAO JO 7110.65, Para 9−2−13, Military Aerial Refueling._

**2−1−12. MILITARY PROCEDURES**

Military procedures in the form of additions,
modifications, and exceptions to the basic FAA
procedure are prescribed herein when a common
procedure has not been attained or to fulfill a specific
requirement. They must be applied by:

**a. ATC facilities operated by that military service.**

**_EXAMPLE−_**

**1. An Air Force facility providing service for an Air Force**
_base would apply USAF procedures to all traffic regardless_
_of class._

**2. A Navy facility providing service for a Naval Air Station**
_would apply USN procedures to all traffic regardless of_
_class._

**b. ATC facilities, regardless of their parent**
organization (FAA, USAF, USN, USA), supporting
a designated military airport exclusively. This
designation determines which military procedures
are to be applied.

**_EXAMPLE−_**

**1. An FAA facility supports a USAF base exclusively;**
_USAF procedures are applied to all traffic at that base._

**2. An FAA facility provides approach control service for a**
_Naval Air Station as well as supporting a civil airport;_
_basic FAA procedures are applied at both locations by the_
_FAA facility._

**3. A USAF facility supports a USAF base and provides**
_approach control service to a satellite civilian airport;_
_USAF procedures are applied at both locations by the_
_USAF facility._

**_REFERENCE−_**

_FAAO JO 7110.65, Para 1−2−5, Annotations._

**c. Other ATC facilities when specified in a letter of**
agreement.

**_EXAMPLE−_**
_A USAF unit is using a civil airport supported by an FAA_
_facility− USAF procedures will be applied as specified in_
_a letter of agreement between the unit and the FAA facility_
_to the aircraft of the USAF unit. Basic FAA procedures will_
_be applied to all other aircraft._


**2−1−13. FORMATION FLIGHTS**

**a. Control formation flights as a single aircraft.**
When individual control is requested, issue advisory
information which will assist the pilots in attaining
separation. When pilot reports indicate separation has
been established, issue control instructions as
required.

**_NOTE−_**
**1. Separation responsibility between aircraft within the**
_formation during transition to individual control rests with_
_the pilots concerned until approved separation has been_
_attained._

**2. Formation join-up and breakaway will be conducted in**
_VFR weather conditions unless prior authorization has_
_been obtained from ATC or individual control has been_
_approved._

**_REFERENCE−_**
_FAAO JO 7110.65, Para 5−5−8, Additional Separation for Formation_
_Flights._
_P/CG Term− Formation Flight._

**b. Military and civil formation flights in RVSM**
airspace.

**1. Utilize RVSM separation standards for a**
formation flight, which consists of all RVSM
approved aircraft.

**2. Utilize non−RVSM separation standards for**
a formation flight above FL 290, which does not
consist of all RVSM approved aircraft.

**3. If aircraft are requesting to form a formation**
flight to FL 290 or above, the controller who issues
the clearance creating the formation flight is
responsible for ensuring that the proper equipment
suffix is entered for the lead aircraft.

**4. If the flight departs as a formation, and is**
requesting FL 290 or above, the first center sector
must ensure that the proper equipment suffix is
entered.

**5. If the formation flight is below FL 290 and**
later requests FL 290 or above, the controller
receiving the RVSM altitude request must ensure the
proper equipment suffix is entered.

**6. Upon break−up of the formation flight, the**
controller initiating the break−up must ensure that all
aircraft or flights are assigned their proper equipment
suffix.

**2−1−14. COORDINATE USE OF AIRSPACE**

**a. Ensure that the necessary coordination has been**
accomplished before you allow an aircraft under your


2−1−6 General


-----

control to enter another controller’s area of

jurisdiction.

**b. Before you issue a control instruction directly to**
a pilot that will change the aircraft’s heading, route,
speed, or altitude, you must ensure that coordination
has been completed with all controllers whose area of
jurisdiction is affected by those instructions unless
otherwise specified by a letter of agreement or facility
directive. If your control instruction will be relayed to
the pilot through a source other than another radar
controller (FSS, ARINC, another pilot, etc.), you are
still responsible to ensure that all required coordination is completed.

**_NOTE−_**
**1. It is good operating practice for controllers to confirm**
_that required coordination has been/will be effected,_
_especially in unusual circumstances, such as recently_
_modified sector configurations, airspace changes, route_
_changes, etc._

**2. Ensuring that all required coordination has been**
_completed does not necessarily imply that the controller_
_issuing the control instruction directly to the pilot has to_
_perform the coordination action._

eliminating any potential conflict with other aircraft
for which you have separation responsibility.

**c. Assume control of an aircraft only after it is in**
your area of jurisdiction unless specifically coordin

ated or as specified by letter of agreement or a facility
directive.

**2−1−16. SURFACE AREAS**

**a. Coordinate with the appropriate nonapproach**
control tower on an individual aircraft basis before
issuing a clearance which would require flight within
a surface area for which the tower has responsibility
unless otherwise specified in a letter of agreement.

**2−1−17. RADIO COMMUNICATIONS**

**a. Transfer radio communications before an**
aircraft enters the receiving controller’s area of
jurisdiction unless otherwise coordinated or specified
by a letter of agreement or a facility directive.

**b. Transfer radio communications by specifying**
the following:

**_NOTE−_**
_Radio communications transfer procedures may be_
_specified by a letter of agreement or contained in the route_
_description of an MTR as published in the DOD Planning_
_AP/1B (AP/3)._

**1. The facility name or location name and**
terminal function to be contacted. TERMINAL: Omit

_“Contact Huntington Radio.”_
_“Contact Departure.”_
_“Contact Los Angeles Center, One Two Three Point Four.”_

**3. Time, fix, altitude, or specifically when to**
contact a facility. You may omit this when
compliance is expected upon receipt.

**_NOTE−_**
_AIM, para 5−3−1, ARTCC Communications, informs pilots_
_that they are expected to maintain a listening watch on the_
_transferring controller’s frequency until the time, fix, or_
_altitude specified._

**_PHRASEOLOGY−_**
_CONTACT (facility name or location name and terminal_
_function), (frequency)._

_If required,_

_AT (time, fix, or altitude)._

**c. Controllers must, within a reasonable amount of**
time, take appropriate action to establish/restore
communications with all aircraft for which a

communications transfer or initial contact to his/her
sector is expected/required.

**_NOTE−_**
_For the purposes of this paragraph, a reasonable amount_
_of time is considered to be 5 minutes from the time the_
_aircraft enters the controller’s area of jurisdiction or comes_
_within range of radio/communications coverage. Commu-_


_nications include two−way VHF or UHF radio contact,_
_data link, or high frequency (HF) radio through an_
_approved third−party provider such as ARINC._

**d. In situations where an operational advantage**
will be gained, and following coordination with the
receiving controller, you may instruct aircraft on the
ground to monitor the receiving controller’s
frequency.

**_EXAMPLE−_**

_“Monitor Tower.”_

_“Monitor Ground.”_

_“Monitor Ground Point Seven.”_

_“Monitor Ground, One Two Zero Point Eight.”_

**e. In situations where a sector has multiple**
frequencies or when sectors are combined using
multiple frequencies and the aircraft will remain
under your jurisdiction, transfer radio communication by specifying the following:

**_PHRASEOLOGY−_**
_(Identification) CHANGE TO MY FREQUENCY (state_
_frequency)._

**_EXAMPLE−_**
_“United two twenty-two change to my frequency one two_
_three point four.”_

**_REFERENCE−_**

_AIM, Para 4−2−3, Contact Procedures._

**f. Avoid issuing a frequency change to helicopters**
known to be single-piloted during air-taxiing,
hovering, or low-level flight. Whenever possible,
relay necessary control instructions until the pilot is
able to change frequency.

**_NOTE−_**
_Most light helicopters are flown by one pilot and require_
_the constant use of both hands and feet to maintain control._
_Although Flight Control Friction Devices assist the pilot,_
_changing frequency near the ground could result in_
_inadvertent ground contact and consequent loss of control._
_Pilots are expected to advise ATC of their single-pilot_
_status if unable to comply with a frequency change._

**_REFERENCE−_**

Unless an aircraft is operating within Class A airspace
or omission is requested by the pilot, issue traffic
advisories to all aircraft (IFR or VFR) on your
frequency when, in your judgment, their proximity
may diminish to less than the applicable separation
minima. Where no separation minima applies, such
as for VFR aircraft outside of Class B/Class C
airspace, or a TRSA, issue traffic advisories to those
aircraft on your frequency when in your judgment
their proximity warrants it. Provide this service as
follows:

**a. To radar identified aircraft:**

**1. Azimuth from aircraft in terms of the 12−hour**

clock, or

**2. When rapidly maneuvering aircraft prevent**
accurate issuance of traffic as in 1 above, specify the
direction from an aircraft’s position in terms of the
eight cardinal compass points (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW,
W, and NW). This method must be terminated at the
pilot’s request.

**3. Distance from aircraft in miles.**

**4. Direction in which traffic is proceeding**
and/or relative movement of traffic.

**2−1−27. TCAS RESOLUTION ADVISORIES**

**a. When an aircraft under your control jurisdiction**
informs you that it is responding to a TCAS
Resolution Advisory (RA), do not issue control
instructions that are contrary to the RA procedure that
a crew member has advised you that they are
executing. Provide safety alerts regarding terrain or
obstructions and traffic advisories for the aircraft
responding to the RA and all other aircraft under your
control jurisdiction, as appropriate.

**b. Unless advised by other aircraft that they are**
also responding to a TCAS RA, do not assume that
other aircraft in the proximity of the responding
aircraft are involved in the RA maneuver or are aware
of the responding aircraft’s intended maneuvers.
Continue to provide control instructions, safety
alerts, and traffic advisories as appropriate to such
aircraft.

**c. Once the responding aircraft has begun a**
maneuver in response to an RA, the controller is not
responsible for providing approved separation
between the aircraft that is responding to an RA and
any other aircraft, airspace, terrain or obstructions.


Responsibility for approved separation resumes
when one of the following conditions are met:

**1. The responding aircraft has returned to its**
assigned altitude, or

**2. A crew member informs you that the TCAS**
maneuver is completed and you observe that
approved separation has been reestablished, or

**3. The responding aircraft has executed an**
alternate clearance and you observe that approved
separation has been reestablished.

**_NOTE−_**
**1. AC 120−55C, Air Carrier Operational Approval and**
_Use of TCAS II, suggests pilots use the following_
_phraseology to notify controllers during TCAS events._
_When a TCAS RA may affect an ATC clearance, inform_
_ATC when beginning the maneuver, or as soon as workload_
_permits._

**_EXAMPLE−_**

**1. “New York Center, United 321, TCAS climb.”**

**_NOTE−_**
**2. When the RA has been resolved, the flight crew should**
_advise ATC they are returning to their previously assigned_
_clearance or subsequent amended clearance._

**_EXAMPLE−_**
**2. “New York Center, United 321, clear of conflict,**
_returning to assigned altitude.”_

**2−1−28. RVSM OPERATIONS**

Controller responsibilities must include but not be
limited to the following:

**a. Non−RVSM aircraft operating in RVSM**
airspace.

**1. Ensure non-RVSM aircraft are not permitted**
in RVSM airspace unless they meet the criteria of
excepted aircraft and are previously approved by the
operations supervisor/CIC. The following aircraft are
excepted: DOD, DOD-certified aircraft operated by
NASA (T38, F15, F18, WB57, S3, and U2 aircraft
only), MEDEVAC, manufacturer aircraft being
flown for development/certification, and Foreign
State aircraft. These exceptions are accommodated
on a workload or traffic-permitting basis.

**_NOTE−_**
_The operations supervisor/CIC is responsible for system_
_acceptance of a non−RVSM aircraft beyond the initial_
_sector−to−sector coordination following the pilot request_
_to access the airspace. Operations supervisor/CIC_

**2−1−29. TERRAIN AWARENESS WARNING**
**SYSTEM (TAWS) ALERTS**

**a. When an aircraft under your control jurisdiction**
informs you that it is responding to a TAWS (or other
on−board low altitude) alert, do not issue control
instructions that are contrary to the TAWS procedure
that a crew member has advised you that they are
executing. Provide safety alerts regarding terrain or
obstructions and traffic advisories for the aircraft
responding to the TAWS alert and all other aircraft
under your control jurisdiction, as appropriate.

**b. Once the responding aircraft has begun a**
maneuver in response to TAWS alert, the controller is
not responsible for providing approved separation
between the aircraft that is responding to a TAWS
alert and any other aircraft, airspace, terrain or
obstructions. Responsibility for approved separation
resumes when one of the following conditions are

met:

**1. The responding aircraft has returned to its**
assigned altitude, or

**2. A crew member informs you that the TAWS**
maneuver is completed and you observe that
approved separation has been reestablished, or

**3. The responding aircraft has executed an**
alternate clearance and you observe that approved
separation has been reestablished.

**2−1−30. “BLUE LIGHTNING” EVENTS**

Ensure that the supervisor/controller−in−charge
(CIC) is notified of reports of possible human
trafficking. These may be referred to as “Blue
Lightning” events.

## Section 2. Flight Plans and Control Information


**2−2−1. RECORDING INFORMATION**

**a. Record flight plan information required by the**
type of flight plan and existing circumstances. Use
authorized abbreviations when possible.

**_NOTE−_**
_Generally, all military overseas flights are required to_
_clear through a specified military base operations office_
_(BASOPS). Pilots normally will not file flight plans directly_
_with an FAA facility unless a BASOPS is not available._
_BASOPS will, in turn, forward the IFR flight notification_
_message to the appropriate center._

**b. EN ROUTE. When flight plans are filed directly**
with the center, record all items given by the pilot
either on a flight progress strip/flight data entry or on
a voice recorder. If the latter, enter in box 26 of the
initial flight progress strip the sector or position
number to identify where the information may be
found in the event search and rescue (SAR) activities
become necessary.

**_REFERENCE−_**

_FAAO JO 7110.65, Para 2−3−2, En Route Data Entries._

**2−2−2. FORWARDING INFORMATION**

**a. Except during EAS FDP operation, forward the**
flight plan information to the appropriate ATC
facility, FSS, or BASOPS and record the time of filing
and delivery on the form.

**b. EN ROUTE. During EAS FDP operation, the**
above manual actions are required in cases where the
data is not forwarded automatically by the computer.

**_NOTE−_**
_During EAS FDP operation, data is exchanged between_
_interfaced automated facilities and both the data and time_
_of transmission are recorded automatically._

**c. EN ROUTE. Forward proposed tower en route**
flight plans and any related amendments to the
appropriate departure terminal facility.

**2−2−3. FORWARDING VFR DATA**

_TERMINAL_

_will include the phrase “DVFR to (destination)” in their_
_initial call-up to an FAA-operated tower._

**2−2−5. IFR TO VFR FLIGHT PLAN CHANGE**

Request a pilot to contact the appropriate FSS if the
pilot informs you of a desire to change from an IFR
to a VFR flight plan.

**2−2−6. IFR FLIGHT PROGRESS DATA**

Forward control information from controller to
controller within a facility, then to the receiving
facility as the aircraft progresses along its route.
Where appropriate, use computer equipment in lieu
of manual coordination procedures. Do not use the
remarks section of flight progress strips in lieu of
voice coordination to pass control information.
Ensure that flight plan and control information is
correct and up-to-date. When covered by a letter of
agreement/facility directive, the time requirements of
subpara a may be reduced, and the time requirements
of subpara b1 and para 2−2−11, Forwarding
Amended and UTM Data, subpara a may be increased
up to 15 minutes when facilitated by automated
systems or mandatory radar handoffs; or if
operationally necessary because of manual data
processing or nonradar operations, the time requirements of subpara a may be increased.

**_NOTE−_**
**1. The procedures for preparing flight plan and control**
_information related to altitude reservations (ALTRVs) are_
_contained in FAAO JO 7210.3, para 8−1−2, Facility_

## Section 3. Flight Progress Strips


**2−3−1. GENERAL**

Unless otherwise authorized in a facility directive,
use flight progress strips to post current data on
air traffic and clearances required for control and
other air traffic control services. To prevent
misinterpretation when data is hand printed, use
standard hand-printed characters.
En route: Flight progress strips must be posted.

**_REFERENCE−_**
_FAAO JO 7210.3, Para_ _6−1−6, Flight Progress Strip Usage._

**a. Maintain only necessary current data and**
remove the strips from the flight progress boards
when no longer required for control purposes. To
correct, update, or preplan information:

**1. Do not erase or overwrite any item. Use an**
“X” to delete a climb/descend and maintain arrow, an
at or above/below symbol, a cruise symbol, and
unwanted altitude information. Write the new altitude
information immediately adjacent to it and within the

same space.

**2. Do not draw a horizontal line through an**
altitude being vacated until after the aircraft has


reported or is observed (valid Mode C) leaving the
altitude.

**3. Preplanning may be accomplished in red**
pencil.

**b. Manually prepared strips must conform to the**
format of machine-generated strips and manual strip
preparation procedures will be modified simultaneously with the operational implementation of
changes in the machine-generated format.
(See FIG 2−3−1.)

**c. Altitude information may be written in**
thousands of feet provided the procedure is
authorized by the facility manager, and is defined in
a facility directive, i.e. 5,000 feet as 5, and 2,800 as
2.8.

**_NOTE−_**
_A slant line crossing through the number zero and_
_underline of the letter “s” on handwritten portions of flight_
_progress strips are required only when there is reason to_
_believe the lack of these markings could lead to_
_misunderstanding. A slant line crossing through the_
_number zero is required on all weather data._

**2−3−7. USAF/USN UNDERGRADUATE**
**PILOTS**

To identify aircraft piloted by solo USAF/USN
undergraduate student pilots (who may occasionally
request revised clearances because they normally are
restricted to flight in VFR conditions), the aircraft
identification in the flight plan shall include the letter
“Z” as a suffix. Do not use this suffix, however, in
ground-to-air communication.

**_NOTE−_**
_USAF solo students who have passed an instrument_
_certification check may penetrate cloud layers in climb or_
_descent only. Requests for revised clearances to avoid_
_clouds in level flight can still be expected. This does not_


_change the requirement to use the letter “Z” as a suffix to_
_the aircraft identification._

Use an appropriate clearance symbol followed by a
dash (−) and other pertinent information to clearly
show the clearance status of an aircraft. To indicate
delay status use:

**a. The symbol “H” at the clearance limit when**
holding instructions have been included in the
aircraft’s original clearance. Show detailed holding
information following the dash when holding differs
from the established pattern for the fix; i.e., turns, leg

## Section 4. Radio and Interphone Communications


**2−4−1. RADIO COMMUNICATIONS**

Use radio frequencies for the special purposes for
which they are intended. A single frequency may be
used for more than one function except as follows:

_TERMINAL. When combining positions in the tower,_
do not use ground control frequency for airborne
communications.

**_NOTE−_**
_Due to the limited number of frequencies assigned to_
_towers for the ground control function, it is very likely that_
_airborne use of a ground control frequency could cause_
_interference to other towers or interference to your aircraft_
_from another tower. When combining these functions, it is_
_recommended combining them on local control. The ATIS_
_may be used to specify the desired frequency._

**2−4−2. MONITORING**

Monitor interphones and assigned radio frequencies
continuously.

**_NOTE−_**
_Although all FAA facilities, including RAPCONs and_
_RATCFs, are required to monitor all assigned frequencies_
_continuously, USAF facilities may not monitor all_
_unpublished discrete frequencies._

**2−4−3. PILOT ACKNOWLEDGMENT/READ**
**BACK**

Ensure pilots acknowledge all Air Traffic Clearances
and ATC Instructions. When a pilot reads back an Air
Traffic Clearance or ATC Instruction:

**a. Ensure that items read back are correct.**

**b. Ensure the read back of hold short instructions,**
whether a part of taxi instructions or a LAHSO
clearance.

**c. Ensure pilots use call signs and/or registration**
numbers in any read back acknowledging an Air
Traffic Clearance or ATC Instruction.

**_NOTE−_**
**_1. ATC Clearance/Instruction Read Back guidance for_**
_pilots in the AIM states:_
**_a. Although pilots should read back the “numbers,” unless_**
_otherwise required by procedure or controller request,_


_pilots may acknowledge clearances, control instructions,_
_or other information by using “Wilco,” “Roger,”_
_“Affirmative,” or other words or remarks with their_
_aircraft identification._
**_b. Altitudes contained in charted procedures, such as_**
_departure procedures, instrument approaches, etc., need_
_not be read back unless they are specifically stated by the_
_controller._
**_c. Initial read back of a taxi, departure or landing_**
_clearance should include the runway assignment,_
_including left, right, center, etc. if applicable._
**_2. Until a pilot acknowledges a controller’s clearance or_**
_instruction, a controller cannot know if a pilot will comply_
_with the clearance or remain as previously cleared._

**_EXAMPLE−_**
_“Climbing to Flight Level three three zero, United Twelve”_
_or “November Five Charlie Tango, roger, cleared to land_
_runway four left.”_

_AIM Para 6-4-1, Two-way Radio Communications Failure_
_Federal Register, April 1, 1999 14 CFR Part 91 Pilot Responsibility for_
_Compliance with ATC Clearances and Instructions_

**2−4−4. AUTHORIZED INTERRUPTIONS**

As necessary, authorize a pilot to interrupt his/her
communications guard.

**_NOTE−_**
_Some users have adopted procedures to ensure uninterrup-_
_ted receiving capability with ATC when a pilot with only_
_one operative communications radio must interrupt_
_his/her communications guard because of a safety related_
_problem requiring airborne communications with his/her_
_company. In this event, pilots will request approval to_
_abandon guard on the assigned ATC frequency for a_
_mutually agreeable time period. Additionally, they will_
_inform controllers of the NAVAID voice facility and the_
_company frequency they will monitor._

**2−4−5. AUTHORIZED TRANSMISSIONS**

Transmit only those messages necessary for air traffic
control or otherwise contributing to air safety.

**_REFERENCE−_**

JO 7110.65W 12/10/15


**2−4−6. FALSE OR DECEPTIVE**

**COMMUNICATIONS**

Take action to detect, prevent, and report false,
deceptive, or phantom controller communications to
an aircraft or controller. The following must be
accomplished when false or deceptive communications occur:

**a. Correct false information.**

**b. Broadcast an alert to aircraft operating on all**
frequencies within the area where deceptive or
phantom transmissions have been received.

**_EXAMPLE−_**
_“Attention all aircraft. False ATC instructions have been_
_received in the area of Long Beach Airport. Exercise_
_extreme caution on all frequencies and verify_
_instructions.”_

**c. Collect pertinent information regarding the**
incident.

**d. Notify the operations supervisor of the false,**
deceptive, or phantom transmission and report all
relevant information pertaining to the incident.

**2−4−7. AUTHORIZED RELAYS**

**a. Relay operational information to aircraft or**
aircraft operators as necessary. Do not agree to handle
such messages on a regular basis. Give the source of
any such message you relay.

**b. Relay official FAA messages as required.**

**_NOTE−_**
_The FAA Administrator and Deputy Administrator will_
_sometimes use code phrases to identify themselves in_
_air-to-ground communications as follows:_
_Administrator: “SAFEAIR ONE.”_
_Deputy Administrator: “SAFEAIR TWO.”_

**_EXAMPLE−_**

_“Miami Center, Jetstar One, this is SAFEAIR ONE,_
_(message).”_

**c. Relay operational information to military**
aircraft operating on, or planning to operate on IRs.

**2−4−8. RADIO MESSAGE FORMAT**

Use the following format for radio communications
with an aircraft:

**a. Sector/position on initial radio contact:**

**1. Identification of aircraft.**


**2. Identification of ATC unit.**

**3. Message (if any).**

**4. The word “over” if required.**

**b. Subsequent radio transmissions from the same**
sector/position must use the same format, except the
identification of the ATC unit may be omitted.

_TERMINAL. You may omit aircraft identification_
after initial contact when conducting the final portion
of a radar approach.

**_REFERENCE−_**
_FAAO JO 7110.65, Para 2−4−20, Aircraft Identification._

**2−4−9. ABBREVIATED TRANSMISSIONS**

Transmissions may be abbreviated as follows:

**a. Use the identification prefix and the last 3 digits**
or letters of the aircraft identification after

communications have been established. Do not
abbreviate similar sounding aircraft identifications or
the identification of an air carrier or other civil aircraft
having an FAA authorized call sign.

**_REFERENCE−_**
_FAAO JO 7110.65, Para 2−4−20, Aircraft Identification._

**b. Omit the facility identification after communi-**
cation has been established.

**c. Transmit the message immediately after the**
callup (without waiting for the aircraft’s reply) when
the message is short and receipt is generally assured.

**d. Omit the word “over” if the message obviously**
requires a reply.

**2−4−10. INTERPHONE TRANSMISSION**

**PRIORITIES**

Give priority to interphone transmissions as follows:

**a. First priority. Emergency messages including**
essential information on aircraft accidents or
suspected accidents. After an actual emergency has
passed, give a lower priority to messages relating to
that accident.

**b. Second priority. Clearances and control**
instructions.

will not be confused with another position.

**_NOTE−_**
_Other means of identifying a position, such as substituting_
_departure or arrival gate/fix names for position identifica-_
_tion, may be used. However, it must be operationally_
_beneficial, and the procedure fully covered in a letter of_
_agreement or a facility directive, as appropriate._

**_EXAMPLE−_**
**_Caller: “Albuquerque Center Sixty Three, Amarillo_**
_Departure.”_

**_Receiver: “Albuquerque Center.”_**

_Two.”_

**c. Caller states the type of coordination to be**
accomplished when advantageous. For example,
handoff or APREQ.

**d. The caller states the message.**

**e. The receiver states the response to the caller’s**
message followed by the receiver’s operating initials.

case, the corresponding fourth line entry is
“D20R/ONL” or “D20R/F.”

**2. The absence of a NAVAID, waypoint, or /F in**
the fourth line indicates that:

**(a) The pilot has been authorized to deviate**
for weather only, and the receiving controller must
provide a clearance to rejoin the route in accordance
with paragraph 2-1-15c.

**_EXAMPLE−_**
_“Deviation twenty degrees right approved, advise_

**2−6−6. REPORTING WEATHER**

**CONDITIONS**

**a. When the prevailing visibility at the usual point**
of observation, or at the tower level, is less than
4 miles, tower personnel must take prevailing
visibility observations and apply the observations as
follows:

**1. Use the lower of the two observations (tower**
or surface) for aircraft operations.

**2. Forward tower visibility observations to the**
weather observer.

**3. Notify the weather observer when the tower**
observes the prevailing visibility decrease to less than
4 miles or increase to 4 miles or more.

**b. Forward current weather changes to the**
appropriate control facility as follows:

**1. When the official weather changes to a**
condition which is below 1,000−foot ceiling or below
the highest circling minimum, whichever is greater,
or less than 3 miles visibility, and when it improves
to a condition which is better than those above.

**2. Changes which are classified as special**
weather observations during the time that weather
conditions are below 1,000−foot ceiling or the
highest circling minimum, whichever is greater, or
less than 3 miles visibility.

**c. Towers at airports where military turbo-jet**
en route descents are routinely conducted must also
report the conditions to the ARTCC even if it is not the
controlling facility.

**d. If the receiving facility informs you that**
weather reports are not required for a specific time
period, discontinue the reports. The time period
specified should not exceed the duration of the
receiving controller’s tour of duty.

specific values, and any elements derived directly
from instruments, pilots, or radar may be transmitted
to pilots or other ATC facilities without consulting the
weather reporting station.


**b. Specific values, such as ceiling and visibility,**
may be transmitted if obtained by one of the
following means:

**1. You are properly certificated and acting as**
official weather observer for the elements being
reported.

**_NOTE−_**
_USAF controllers do not serve as official weather_
_observers._

**2. You have obtained the information from the**
official observer for the elements being reported.

**3. The weather report was composed or verified**
by the weather station.

**4. The information is obtained from an official**
Automated Weather Observation System (AWOS) or

**a. TERMINAL. Identify the source of an altimeter**
setting when issued for a location other than the
aircraft’s departure or destination airport.

**b. EN ROUTE. Identify the source of all altimeter**
settings when issued.

**_PHRASEOLOGY−_**
_(If the altimeter is one hour old or less),_
_THE (facility name) ALTIMETER (setting)._

_or_

_(If the altimeter is more than one hour old),_
_THE (facility name) ALTIMETER (setting) MORE THAN_
_ONE HOUR OLD._

**c. Issue the altimeter setting:**

**1. To en route aircraft at least one time while**
operating in your area of jurisdiction. Issue the setting
for the nearest reporting station along the aircraft’s
route of flight:

**_NOTE−_**
_14 CFR Section 91.121(1) requires that the pilot set his/her_
_altimeter to the setting of a station along his/her route of_
_flight within 100 miles of the aircraft if one is available._
_However, issuance of the setting of an adjacent station_
_during periods that a steep gradient exists will serve to_
_inform the pilot of the difference between the setting he/she_
_is using and the pressure in the local area and better enable_


_him/her to choose a more advantageous setting within the_
_limitations of 14 CFR Section 91.121._

**2. TERMINAL. To all departures. Unless spe-**
cifically requested by the pilot, the altimeter setting
need not be issued to local aircraft operators who have
requested this omission in writing or to scheduled air
carriers.

**_REFERENCE−_**
_FAAO JO 7110.65, Para 3−9−1, Departure Information._

**3. TERMINAL. To arriving aircraft on initial**
contact or as soon as possible thereafter. The tower
may omit the altimeter if the aircraft is sequenced or
vectored to the airport by the approach control having
jurisdiction at that facility.

**4. EN ROUTE. For the destination airport to**
arriving aircraft, approximately 50 miles from the
destination, if an approach control facility does not
serve the airport.

**5. In addition to the altimeter setting provided**
on initial contact, issue changes in altimeter setting to
aircraft executing a nonprecision instrument
approach as frequently as practical when the official
weather report includes the remarks “pressure falling
rapidly.”

**d. If the altimeter setting must be obtained by the**
pilot of an arriving aircraft from another source,
instruct the pilot to obtain the altimeter setting from
that source.

**_NOTE−_**
**1. The destination altimeter setting, whether from a local**
_or remote source, is the setting upon which the instrument_
_approach is predicated._

**2. Approach charts for many locations specify the source**
_of altimeter settings as non−FAA facilities, such as_
_UNICOMs._

**e. When issuing clearance to descend below the**
lowest usable flight level, advise the pilot of the
altimeter setting of the weather reporting station
nearest the point the aircraft will descend below that
flight level.

**f. Department of Defense (DOD) aircraft that are**

## Section 9. Automatic Terminal Informatio Service Procedures


**2−9−1. APPLICATION**

Use the ATIS, where available, to provide advance
noncontrol airport/terminal area and meteorological
information to aircraft.

**a. Identify each ATIS message by a phonetic letter**
code word at both the beginning and the end of the
message. Automated systems will have the phonetic
letter code automatically appended. Exceptions may
be made where omissions are required because of
special programs or equipment.

**1. Each alphabet letter phonetic word must be**
used sequentially, except as authorized in subpara a2,
beginning with “Alpha,” ending with “Zulu,” and
repeated without regard to the beginning of a new
day. Identify the first resumed broadcast message
with “Alpha” or the first assigned alphabet letter
word in the event of a broadcast interruption of more
than 12 hours.

**2. Specific sequential portions of the alphabet**
may be assigned between facilities or an arrival and
departure ATIS when designated by a letter of
agreement or facility directive.

**_REFERENCE−_**
_FAAO JO 7210.3, Para 10−4−1, Automatic Terminal Information_
_Service (ATIS)._

**b. The ATIS recording must be reviewed for**
completeness, accuracy, speech rate, and proper
enunciation before being transmitted.

**c. Arrival and departure messages, when broad-**
cast separately, need only contain information
appropriate for that operation.

**2−9−2. OPERATING PROCEDURES**

Maintain an ATIS message that reflects the most
current arrival and departure information.

**a. Make a new recording when any of the**
following occur:


**1. Upon receipt of any new official weather**
regardless of whether there is or is not a change in
values.

**2. When runway braking action reports are**
received that indicate runway braking is worse than
that which is included in the current ATIS broadcast.

**3. When there is a change in any other pertinent**
data, such as runway change, instrument approach in
use, new or canceled NOTAMs/PIREPs/HIWAS
update, etc.

**b. When a pilot acknowledges that he/she has**
received the ATIS broadcast, controllers may omit
those items contained in the broadcasts if they are
current. Rapidly changing conditions will be issued
by ATC, and the ATIS will contain the following:

**_EXAMPLE−_**
_“Latest ceiling/visibility/altimeter/wind/(other condi-_
_tions) will be issued by approach control/tower.”_

**c. Broadcast on all appropriate frequencies to**
advise aircraft of a change in the ATIS code/message.

**d. Controllers must ensure that pilots receive the**
most current pertinent information. Ask the pilot to
confirm receipt of the current ATIS information if the
pilot does not initially state the appropriate ATIS
code. Controllers must ensure that changes to
pertinent operational information is provided after
the initial confirmation of ATIS information is
established. Issue the current weather, runway in use,
approach information, and pertinent NOTAMs to
pilots who are unable to receive the ATIS.

**_EXAMPLE−_**
_“Verify you have information ALPHA.”_

_“Information BRAVO now current, visibility three miles.”_

_“Information CHARLIE now current, Ceiling 1500_
_Broken.”_

_“Information CHARLIE now current, advise when you_
_have CHARLIE.”_

Include the following in ATIS broadcast as
appropriate:

**a. Airport/facility name, phonetic letter code, time**
of weather sequence (UTC). Weather information
consisting of wind direction and velocity, visibility,
obstructions to vision, present weather, sky condition, temperature, dew point, altimeter, a density
altitude advisory when appropriate and other
pertinent remarks included in the official weather
observation. Wind direction, velocity, and altimeter
must be reported from certified direct reading
instruments. Temperature and dew point should be
reported from certified direct reading sensors when
available. Always include weather observation
remarks of lightning, cumulonimbus, and towering
cumulus clouds.

**_NOTE−_**
_ASOS/AWOS is to be considered the primary source of_
_wind direction, velocity, and altimeter data for weather_
_observation purposes at those locations that are so_
_equipped. The ASOS Operator Interface Device (OID)_
_displays the magnetic wind as “MAG WND” in the_
_auxiliary data location in the lower left−hand portion of the_
_screen. Other OID displayed winds are true and are not to_
_be used for operational purposes._

**b. Man−Portable** Air Defense Systems
(MANPADS) alert and advisory. Specify the nature
and location of threat or incident, whether reported or
observed and by whom, time (if known), and
notification to pilots to advise ATC if they need to
divert.

**d. The ceiling/sky condition, visibility, and**
obstructions to vision may be omitted if the ceiling is
above 5,000 feet and the visibility is more than
5 miles.

**_EXAMPLE−_**
_A remark may be made, “The weather is better than_
_five thousand and five.”_

**e. Instrument/visual approach/es in use. Specify**
landing runway/s unless the runway is that to which
the instrument approach is made. Before advertising
non-precision approaches, priority should be given to
available precision, then APV approaches.

**h. When a runway length has been temporarily or**
permanently shortened, ensure that the word
“WARNING” prefaces the runway number, and that
the word “shortened” is also included in the text of the

message.

**1. Available runway length, as stated in the**
NOTAM, must be included in the ATIS broadcast.
This information must be broadcast for the duration
of the construction project.

**2. For permanently shortened runways, facilit-**
ies must continue to broadcast this information for a
minimum of 30 days or until the Chart Supplement
U.S. has been updated, whichever is longer.
